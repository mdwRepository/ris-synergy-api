# RIS Synergy


RIS Synergy is a pivotal initiative aimed at streamlining and enhancing the Austrian research landscape through the standardization and digitization of services and the development of expert networks. The project focuses on creating open access and exchange opportunities among funding organizations, research institutions, and public administration systems, thereby establishing a sustainable foundation for the digitization of Austria's research sector. “RIS Synergy provides the basis for the digitalization of the research sector in Austria” (forschungsdaten.at).


The project focuses heavily on developing interfaces that harmonize the flow of metadata across various systems. Collaboration among working groups defines user stories and use cases in critical areas such as call information, research output, financial data, and data management plans. These use cases are analyzed and prioritized for implementation to create a seamless exchange of research-related information.


RIS Synergy operates within the Cluster Forschungsdaten, which unites three projects funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science, and Research: RIS Synergy, FAIR Data Austria, and Austrian DataLAB and Services. The cluster focuses on digital transformation by coordinating research information systems and data management infrastructures. RIS Synergy plays a key role within this cluster by enhancing Austria's research infrastructure through targeted standardization and integration.
